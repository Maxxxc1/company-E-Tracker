# Company-E-Tracker

The Company E Tracker is a user-friendly tool designed to efficiently manage employee databases. This application helps businesses keep workforce information organized and easily accessible.


# Description

    The motivation behind building this project was to create an employee database.

    The project was built to gain experience in interacting between a MySQL database and Node.js.

    This project addresses the problem of processing front-end requests into SQL queries and handling the responses.

    Throughout the building process, I learned how to effectively use Inquirer for input and integrate SQL queries with JavaScript.
